#  Dog Breed Explorer Shiny App
This repo contains materials from my EMSAR 2023 Introduction to Shiny workshop

# Applications
There are 5 applications of increasing complexity included here. The final one, app_5.R is available as a Shiny app online https://camarades.shinyapps.io/dog_breed_explorer/

# Datasets
The *dogs dataset is inspired by a TidyTuesday dataset available here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-02-01/

I also combined the dog dataset with some weight data available from: https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/pa9k6c/american_kennel_club_dog_breeds_by_size_dataset/ 

The cats dataset is from this repo: https://github.com/altef/logipar
